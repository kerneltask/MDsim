MD.py

JIT-accelerated molecular dynamics simulator

Uses Velocity Verlet to calculate particle positions with optional Nosé-Hoover thermostat to control temperature

Calculates system and material properties:

  Temperature

  Pressure
  
  Energies (kinetic and potential)
  
  Mean squared displacement (MSD)
  
  Self-diffusion coefficient

Produces an extended XYZ file for visualization in OVITO

Required packages:
    
    numpy
    
    matplotlib
    
    scipy
    
    numba
